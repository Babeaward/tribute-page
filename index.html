        <p>So sorry to hear, so young, rip. Long live the apple <br> <br> <span class="author"> Magik</span></p> <br>

        <h4> </h4>
        <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the
          first
          one Steve Jobs was a great man and an awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day work with Apple
          when i
          get
          old but my dream is to is to own Apple and folow by Steve Jobs way and make gretaer than before it was. But i
          will
          dearly miss Steve Jobs, he is a great man and I will never forget him. <br> <br> <span class="author">

        <h4> So Sad</h4>
        <p>As I heard this sad news via my phone, I am emailing my condelences from my Macbook Pro. Ssteve has left a
          fingerprint on our culture that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family
          and
          friends <br> <br> <span class="author"> Tracy</span></p>

        <h4>Steve Jobs</h4>
        <p> What impact has Steven had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one
          that
          has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I
          interacted online using
          an Apple machine long before I ever encoutered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future i
          dreamed
          of as a kid. And through his vision,
          I have been able to realize my own.You'll be missed Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work. <br> <br>

        <h4> He's gone...</h4>
        <p> A part of my heart has cracked. I didnt know him personally but i felt like I knew him. I will forever
          remember
          him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven hs certainly
          gained an angel. <br> <br> <span class="author"> Anonymous</span>

        <h4> Condolence</h4>
        <p> Dear Apple, I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader and creator in the
          world. I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will
          remember
          him forever.
